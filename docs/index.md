To submit a bug report, ask a question about how to encode a particular text, or make a feature request, please submit an issue here: [https://github.com/lombardpress/lombardpress-schema/issues](https://github.com/lombardpress/lombardpress-schema/issues)

We follow the git-flow model to structure our branching workflow: [http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/). Following this model, the best way to contribute a pull request is to fork the main develop branch, create a feature branch (e.g. feature/new-element-description) and then submit a pull request for your feature branch to be merged back into the main develop branch.
